PianoEmulator musical note to ButtonBass note converter

This was a fun project I did in my first CS course in which I wrote logic to convert musical notes into acceptable notes for the ButtonBass piano emulator online. In the folder is also the musical note version of the Game of Thrones theme. You can put the Game of Thrones theme into the prompt for the converter to get the ButtonBass converted notes. There is a cap on the size of the input, so grab about half of the characters from the music file, convert them, use my program's output and paste into ButtonBass, then repeat for the second half of the characters.
