C++ program to convert musical notes to ButtonBass notes

This was a fun project I did in my first CS course in which I wrote logic to convert musical notes into acceptable notes for the ButtonBass piano emulator online.

The program also verifies musical note sequences to confirm that they are valid before attempting to convert to ButtonBass equivalents.

Download the code and have some fun with a virtualized piano!

There are a lot of files in the directory so below is a breakdown of what's here.

NOTE FOR THE "Game_of_Thrones_Theme.rtf" FILE: DUE TO FORMATTING, IT WILL NOT LOOK EASILY READABLE IN GITHUB'S PREVIEW, DOWNLOAD THE FILE

Files/Folders in the directory:

  Piano_Emulator.html: HTML page with the ButtonBass piano plugin
  
  Game_of_Thrones_Theme.rtf: The musical note version of the Game of Thrones theme, as well as the converted ButtonBass musical notes. You can put the Game of Thrones theme into the prompt for the converter to get the ButtonBass converted notes. There is a cap on the size of the input, so grab about half of the characters from the musical note section, convert them to their ButtonBass equivalents, use my program's output and paste into ButtonBass, then repeat for the second half of the characters.  My program will continue asking for notes to translate until you press the ENTER key or put in an invalid musical note sequence
